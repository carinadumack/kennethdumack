        Protists shape the wastewater microbiome. I investigate biotic interactions among the vast microbial diversity
        in wastewater. For this, I use -omics techniques, bioinformatics, and also microscopy-based approaches.

                An important task of wastewater treatment is the removal of parasites to suppress distribution of
                potentially infectious organisms into the environment. We investigate whether, when, and how these
                parasites are removed. </p>

                Bacteria are the most important actors in wastewater treatment. We invesigate how their community is
                shaped by their most abundant predators â€“ protists.

                Due to a number of methodological drawbacks it was long impossible to exhaustively characterize the
                community of wastewater protists. With most modern sequencing tools we are finally able to get an
                insight what kind of protists dominate under which conditions.
