    <img src="assets/img/protists-in-soil.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-3">
    <p>Protists are important predators of other soil micoorganisms like bacteria and fungi. Accordingly they affect soil functioning and plant health like little puppet masters. Our research focusses on distribution and functioning of protists in surface soils worldwide.</p>

    <img src="assets/img/wwtp.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-3">
    <p>Water is precious resource. Microorganisms are utilized to treat and reclaim wastewaters. We show that protists significantly affect the wastewater microbiomes’ composition and function – contributing to the removal of parasites and excess nutrients.</p>

    <p>Rhizaria are a group of protists with a similar diversity as plants or animals, but their diversity and evolution is among the least understood of all eukaryotes. We explore their evolution and genomic diversity.</p>
